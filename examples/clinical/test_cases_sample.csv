1,"A 44-year- old super-morbidly- obese man body mass index (BMI 63) underwent sleeve gastrectomy for weight loss and was found to have multiple adenomatous fundic gland polyps on final pathology. Subsequent workup included esophagogastroduodenoscopy which revealed innumerable polyps of the remaining gastric fundus and body consistent with fundic gland polyps, normal duodenum without polyps, and Barrett’s oesophagus. Colonoscopy was significant for innumerable polyps of varying sizes up to 1.5 cm throughout the colon, with relative rectal sparing. Biopsies were consistent with tubular adenoma and hyperplastic polyps. Thyroid ultrasound was within normal limits and abdominal CT was significant for left-sided 3.4 cm mesenteric mass representing scarring versus possible desmoid. Family history was significant for colon cancer diagnosed in his maternal grandfather at age 72, paternal grandmother who died of metastatic cancer at age 50 with unknown primary and mother diagnosed with thyroid cancer at age 40. Physical examination was notable for morbid obesity (BMI 45), cardiopulmonary examination within normal limits and abdomen with well-healing surgical scars from prior sleeve gastrectomy."
2,"A 32-year-old man presented to a regional general surgical unit for severe symptomatic anaemia. Within a span of 4 months his haemoglobin dropped by 62 points from 137 gL (N: 135–180 gL). His medical history included epilepsy on Valproate, heart arrhythmia on Flecainide, carpal tunnel syndrome and C5 nerve root compression. He is a non-smoker, rare alcohol user, has two dogs at home, and two children. His family history included his grandfather who had bowel cancer diagnosed at 78 years old, and a grandmother with breast cancer. The first imaging modality was a CT scan showing a large fungating mass in the body of the stomach extending into the pylorus and first part of the duodenum. He underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) to investigate the pathology. Histopathology frequently returned as benign hyperplastic tissue. The first histopathology results reported gastric mucosa with minor foveolar hyperplasia, stromal oedema with minor increase in chronic inflammatory cells. There was no evidence of helicobacter organisms, active gastritis or atypia. Initial scope findings showed carpet-like polyps lining the gastric antrum and body. On a second UGE, tunnel biopsies were performed, showing the carpet-like polyps have progressed into the first part of the duodenum, in comparison to previous UGE The biopsy returned as Helicobacter heilmannii-associated chronic gastritis with hyperplastic changes of fundic gland polyp. Serum ANA, ANCA, antiparietal cell antibodies, Cytomegalovirus infection serology, hepatitis panel, serum protein electrophoresis, Helicobacter serology and CA 72–4 tumour marker were ordered. Results came back negative except for a positive Helicobacter IgG serology. H. heilmannii was treated with two courses of Helicobacter eradication regime. Repeat UGE, 2 months later, showed no evidence of Helicobacter organism. Histopathology results were hyperplastic gastric polyp with background of mild chronic inflammation. Repeat UGE 3 months after the initial UGE showed Paris classification 0-Isp in the duodenum and the polyps have extended further into the oesophagus. An endoscopic mucosal resection was performed on the oesophageal polyp with histopathology returning as juvenile polyp. Narrow-band imaging of a polyp in the gastric body showed irregular microvascular and irregular microsurface pattern. A colonoscopy revealed two 2–3 mm polyps in the ascending colon and caecum, and one 5 mm semipedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon. The colonic lesions resembled Kudo’s Pit pattern. Histopathology of caecum and descending colon polyps returned as inflammatory juvenile polyps. Capsule endoscopy revealed scattered 0–1 p small bowel polyps and areas of telangiectasia."
