# Examples

This directory contains sample inputs and outputs that illustrate how to run the RAG-HPO pipeline end-to-end.

## Structure

- `synthetic/inputs/` – Synthetic clinical notes and their expected HPO mappings used for automated regression.
- `synthetic/outputs/` – Reference outputs generated by `rag-hpo process` against the synthetic inputs.
- `clinical/` – Smaller curated case snippets and historical runs, useful for manual verification or demos.

The helper script `scripts/evaluate_synthetic.py` defaults to these paths, so you can immediately reproduce the evaluation report after installing dependencies.
